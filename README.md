# Storage-Unit
NAS device based on the Raspberry Pi with support for Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant and other services


Storage devices today donâ€™t do a whole lot and don't even have a lot of storage to begin with. The Storage Unit is different, from the beginning, the ultimate goal in mind was to have a single unit not only hold more than 4 TB, but it had to be accessible over the internet or over a local network. Over time, the original concept had evolved into something more. With Amazon Alexa and AirPlay, the device evolved into having smart speaker capabilities. With the shift into Raspberry Pi 3B from the Raspberry Pi Zero, more power and peripheral was given to the device. Then I gave the Storage Unit a 7 inch touch screen which means controls and apps like Google Chrome can be used directly as an interface to the device. Adding Google Assistant and livens up the system with choices

Originally this device was intended to be a display-less device but for the intention of dynamically configuring the system without the aid of a secondary device it became apparent to design around the focus of a touch screen. The offical 7 inch Touch Screen is offered by the offical Raspberry Pi foundation and connects via external 5V and DSP cables.
